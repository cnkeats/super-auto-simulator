I generated every possible team to have during Round 1 of the Free-to-Play pack and pitted them against each other to figure out what the best teams are. Every team played against every team (including the mirrors!) 100 times and I kept track of all the Wins, Losses, and Draws.

I summarize some of the data in this post, but the full data is at the bottom if you want to take a look for yourself.

&nbsp;

Note that none of this analysis accounts for the meta - there are *thousands* of possible starting teams and some of them are *completely awful*. All of the results in this post include these awful teams in the stats, so the results may not be completely accurate. Just keep that in mind!

...wait, what? What are these squads? How can you get a L1 (4 / 5) fish with Honey on Round 1?

Easy - just buy a Fish, then two Otters that buff the Fish, then sell your Otters and buy Honey! You have to get createive to end up with a lot of these teams.
